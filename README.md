# Autobiographical Portfolio

## Description

The goal of this assignment was to make a website all about me and all that it would entail by showing a mastery of HTML and CSS using key concepts learned in class and rendered in code.

My motivation in completing this challenge was to train myself and fine-tune my coding so that I can avoid frustrating missteps in the future. Exercises like this assignment go a long way in developing the requisite confidence to become a successful web developer.

This project highlights the importance of the end user interaction with websites and pages and gives insight to the programmer on how to make the experience smooth and hassle-free. The HTML and CSS work hand-in-hand to enhance the "wow factor" of a website to draw users in and possibly get them to come back for more.

Not all aspects of my life are included for privacy purposes, but I hope it was all entertaining.

## Installation

The website was composed of HTML, CSS, and links to local files and sites on the internet.

## Usage

The webpage from the challenge allows the user to get a better understanding of me and all that includes.

There are ID links in the header that moves to corresponding sections of the page when clicked. In the 'Employment History' section, can hover the mouse pointer over the pictures, which result in highlighted expansion.

In the 'Contact' section of the page, there are hotlinks for the four respective methods of communication.
