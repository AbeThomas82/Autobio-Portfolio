                I have a computer background in MIS courses in my collegiate career as well as some educational
                background in hardware construction and software development in my high school years.
                </li>
                <li>   
                I have always had an interest in web development and in the server side of things for a long
                time and wish to parlay my hopeful success in this boot camp program into a successful career.
                </li>
                <li>
                With the skills learned in this program, I have to both provide a better life for my family as well
                as for my parents in the near future.
